# Gear Central
An open source and OS independent centralized platform for controlling RGB devices, Macro Key devices and IoT devices

Most gaming devices that support RGB and/or Macro key functionality are usually limited by their simple and proprietary firmwar and which usually only supports Windows systems. This project attempts to create a universal and centralized platform that controls all gaming devices, motherboard lighting and even IoT devices such as external LED strips as one single ecosystem, either trough manual user control or through plugins which act accordingly to the current application in use and which set up macros and lighting according to the current application. The project also attempts to deliver a reliable and easy to use API to use through applications, as well as plugins that extend the ecosystem's functionality.

This project is highly inspired by open source projects such as [OpenRGB](https://github.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB), [LibRatBag](https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag) and even proprietary software such as the [Steel Series Engine](https://steelseries.com/engine).
